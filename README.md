# Case Recommender - A Recommender Framework for Python
Case Recommender is a Python implementation of a number of popular recommendation algorithms for both implicit and explicit feedback.  The framework aims to provide a rich set of components from which you can construct a customized recommender system from a set of algorithms. Case Recommender has different types of item recommendation and rating prediction approaches, and different metrics validation and evaluation.

# Algorithms
Item Recommendation:

- BPR MF

- Item KNN

- Item Attribute KNN

- User KNN

- User Attribute KNN

- Ensemble BPR Learning

- Most Popular

- Random

Rating Prediction:

- Matrix Factorization (with and without baseline)

- SVD ++

- Item KNN

- Item Attribute KNN

- User KNN

- User Attribute KNN

- Item NSVD1 (with and without Batch)

- User NSVD1 (with and without Batch)


# Evaluation and Validation Metrics

- All-but-one Protocol

- Cross-fold- Validation

- Item Recommendation: Precision, Recall and Map

- Rating Prediction: MAE and RMSE

- Statistical Analysis (T-test and Wilcoxon)

# Requirements 

- Python 3
- scipy
- numpy 

For Linux and MAC use:

    $ pip install requiriment

For Windows use:

    http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#matplotlib
    

# Quick start

Case Recommender can be installed using pip:

    $ pip install caserecommender

If you want to run the latest version of the code, you can install from git:
    
    $ pip install -U git+git://github.com/ArthurFortes/CaseRecommender.git
    
# Usage

Divide datasets (Cross Fold Validation)

    >> from caserec.utils.cross_fold_validation import CrossFoldValidation
    >> CrossFoldValidation(input_file=dataset, dir_folds=dir_path, n_folds=10).execute()

Run Item Recommendation Algorithm (E.g: ItemKNN)

    >> from caserec.recommenders.item_recommendation.itemknn import ItemKNN
    >> ItemKNN(train_file, test_file).execute()
    
Run Rating Prediction Algorithm (E.g: ItemKNN)

    >> from caserec.recommenders.rating_prediction.itemknn import ItemKNN
    >> ItemKNN(train_file, test_file).execute()

Evaluate Ranking (Prec@N, Recall@N, Map@N and Map Total)

    >> from caserec.evaluation.item_recommendation import ItemRecommendationEvaluation
    >> ItemRecommendationEvaluation().simple_evaluation(ranking_file, test_file)
    
Evaluate Ranking (MAE and RMSE)

    >> from caserec.evaluation.rating_prediction import RatingPredictionEvaluation
    >> RatingPredictionEvaluation().simple_evaluation(predictions_file, test_file)
