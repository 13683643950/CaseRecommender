# Case Recommender - A Recommender Framework for Python
Case Recommender is a Python implementation of a number of popular recommendation algorithms for both implicit and explicit feedback.  The framework aims to provide a rich set of components from which you can construct a customized recommender system from a set of algorithms. Case Recommender has different types of item recommendation and rating prediction approaches, and different metrics validation and evaluation.

# Algorithms
Item Recommedation:

- BPR MF

- Item KNN

- Item Attribute KNN

- User KNN

- User Attribute KNN

- Enseble BPR Learning

Rating Prediction:

- Matriz Factorization 

- BPR MF

- Item KNN

- Item Attribute KNN

- User KNN

# Evaluation and Validation Metrics

- All-but-one Protocoll

- Cross-fold- Validation

- Item Recommendation: Precision, Recall and Map

- Rating Prediction: MAE and RMSE


# Usage
Soon...

#Input

The input-files of traditional have to be placed in the corresponding subdirectory and are in csv-format with 3 columns 

- User

- Item

- Feedback

Example: user_1\titem_1\tfeedback
